#### When the user clicks on the option, it will turn green if it is correct. If the answer is wrong, the wrong option will be marked red. Once the click is complete, clicking on any of the options on that page will not change the selection.

#### Users can know the quiz completion level by the progress bar on the top. At the same time, users can click on the progress bar to go to the unselected questions. Users can also click on the selected questions to review them, but they cannot change their choices.

#### The user can see the score after completing the last question. Both unselected and incorrect selections are recorded as 0 points. At this point, the user can still go to the unselected question through the progress bar and make a choice. If a correct choice is made, the score will be increased accordingly.
